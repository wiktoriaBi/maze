# Maze Generator and Pathfinding
This project implements a maze generator and pathfinding algorithm in Java 17. The goal is to generate a random maze and visualize it using a JPanel. Additionally, the project includes an algorithm for solving the maze by finding a path from the start to the finish.
## Maze Generator
The maze generation utilizes a randomized algorithm to create a maze with a specified layout. The cells of the maze are represented by a grid, and the algorithm carves passages through the maze randomly, creating a complex network of pathways and dead ends.
## Visualization
The maze is visualized using Java's JPanel to draw the maze on the screen. The cells, passages, walls, and solution path are displayed using different colors, providing a clear representation of the maze structure.
## Pathfinding Algorithm
The pathfinding algorithm aims to find the solution path from the entrance to the exit of the maze. The implemented algorithm explores the maze, considering possible paths and backtracking when necessary, until it finds the optimal route.
